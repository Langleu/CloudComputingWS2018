CPU benchmark questions:
1. Look at linpack.sh and linpack.c and shortly describe how the benchmark
works.

Linpack gives result in floating point operations per second (FLOPS). It performs linear algebra computing operating on systems

2. Find out what the LINPACK benchmark measures (try Google). Would you
expect paravirtualization to affect the LINPACK benchmark? Why?

The Linpack Benchmark is a measure of a computer’s floating-point rate of execution. It is determined by
running a computer program that solves a dense system of linear equations.The linpack benchmark lists the
performance in Mflop/s of a number of computer systems.Since these operations require dedicated access to
host’s resources paravirtualization will have a negative effect on performance of virtualized systems.

3. Look at your LINPACK measurements. Are they consistent with your
expectations? If not, what could be the reason?


Memory benchmark questions:
1. Find out how the memsweep benchmark works by looking at the shell script
and the C code. Would you expect virtualization to affect the memsweep
benchmark? Why?

Memsweep measures the required time to write and clean heap memory from different locations.The locations
are chosen such that a cache miss occurs and data is loaded direct from memory. Since the hypervisor needs
to communicate at HW level for memory requests we get considerably better results for memsweep in no
virtualized systems

2. Look at your memsweep measurements. Are they consistent with your
expectations? If not, what could be the reason?

Disk benchmark questions:
1. Look at the disk measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If
not, what could be the reason?

2. Compare the results for the two operations (sequential, random). What are
reasons for the differences?
